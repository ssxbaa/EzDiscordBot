# üíª ‚Ä¢ Tutorial

- Create an application on the Discord Developer Portal, copy your token and paste it somewhere safe.
- Go to your Application -> OAuth2 -> Check "bot", "applications.commands" in the first box. and then "Administrator" in the second box.
- Copy your link and invite your Bot to your server.
- Create some channels now. Create a Welcome Channel and a Modlogs channel.
- Create two roles, a Staff Role, and an Admin Role. These roles are used to check if a user has the permission to use the commands. For example, mute and unmute commands can be used by Staff but ban and kick commands can be used only by Admins.
- Download the zip file, and unzip it. Navigate into the src folder and open "config.json".
- Here, you need to paste in your token, and replace all that it's in the quotes. You also need to put your channel IDs and role IDs.
- Once you're done, it will look something like this.

- Copy your Server's ID by right clicking on your Server's icon.
- Open the index.js file and replace the 'devGuildID' in line 32 with your Server's ID.
- Open a Command Prompt in the Bot's Folder.
- Download the dependencies by running `npm install`.
- Keep the bot running with `node src/index.js`

# ü§ñ ‚Ä¢ Expand the Bot
You can even expand the bot by yourself and put commands that are not there.
Read the [CommandKit Docs](https://commandkit.js.org/guide/installation) and you can use the `src/templateCommand.js` file, paste it into the commands folder and start making a new command.
